# Frontend Application

## Overview

This is the basic frontend application. This application would implement the
full business case for end users like providing an OTT media service.

The implementation is using a minimum amount of code and third-party libraries.
A real application would need proper error handling and should likely use mature
libraries to help with a better development experience, security, caching and
other concerns.

## Setup and Startup

- Check the root `README.md` file and follow the setup instructions.
- Potential customizations/deviations: check the file `.env` and modify any of
  the variables that might be different in your development environment.
- Run `yarn dev` to start this service
